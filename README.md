# Introduction to JavaScript - Fundamentals of JavaScript

## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate the manipulation of data using JavaScript, specifically focusing on objects and arrays. It provides a system that calculates the average scores of learners in a course based on their submissions for various assignments.

## Installation

To get started with this project:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository from GitHub.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Execute the command `node main.js`.

## Usage

This project serves as a foundational tool for understanding data manipulation with JavaScript. It offers insights into handling and processing learner submissions to compute average scores.

## Course Information

- **Course ID:** 451
- **Course Name:** Introduction to JavaScript

## Assignment Group

- **Group ID:** 12345
- **Group Name:** Fundamentals of JavaScript
- **Group Weight:** 25%
- **Assignments:**
  - Declare a Variable (ID: 1, Due Date: 2023-01-25, Points Possible: 50)
  - Write a Function (ID: 2, Due Date: 2023-02-27, Points Possible: 150)
  - Code the World (ID: 3, Due Date: 3156-11-15, Points Possible: 500)

## Learner Submissions

The system processes learner submissions for assignments to calculate their average scores. It takes into account the due dates of assignments and applies penalties for late submissions.

## Implementation Details

The project, written in JavaScript, includes the following primary functions:

- `getLearnerData`: Computes the average scores of learners based on their submissions.
- `applyLatePenalty`: Implements a penalty for submissions made after the due date.
- `getLearnerSubmissions`: Gathers submissions for a specific learner.
- `getAssignmentInfoById`: Provides details about a specific assignment.
- `calculateAssignmentScore`: Determines the score percentage for an assignment.
- `isSubmissionLate`: Verifies if a submission was made after the due date.
